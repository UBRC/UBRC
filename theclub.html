        <div class = "center-text">
            <h3>What do I need to wear for horse riding?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Comfortable clothing! Trousers which have a little 'give' in them, such as gym leggings or jogging bottoms. Jodphurs can be purchased reasonably cheap - it is worth checking out charity shops in Bristol, depop or eBay for second-hand pairs.</p>
        
        <p>Shoes with a small heel, so no trainers! However, you can rent riding boots for 50p at Urchinwood Manor Stables if you don't own any. If you wish to purchase a pair of riding boots, we suggest that you consider purchasing boots and chaps, rather than long boots, as they are easier to get the right leg position with.</p>

        <p>We do not recommend that you purchase a second-hand riding hat, because if you suffer a fall then their efficiency is reduced. The Club requires you to wear a riding hat which conforms with current PAS safety requirements.</p>

            <h3>Are there opportunities to hack out with the Club?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Yes! There are many opportunities for beach rides and local hacks throughout the year, with more information on our Facebook page as opportunities arise. Even though this academic year was cut short, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we still managed to offer 3 beach rides at Ogmore Beach, which were enjoyed by all. This year, it was Â£40 for a 2-hour beach ride, which includes cantering along the beach, swerving in and out of sand dunes or having a calm walk and chat with your friends!</p>

            <h3>How do I get assigned an ability group?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>When you sign up with the Club and pay membership, you will fill out a simple form asking questions about your riding ability and skill. Our lesson secretaries will then add you to the relevant Facebook group. </p>

        <div class = "center-text">
            <h3>How do I pay for my lesson?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>You simply pay with cash at the Stables' Office before or after your riding lesson.</p>

        <div class = "center-text">
            <h3>Does the Club get involved in Varsity?</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Yes! Varsity provides an opportunity for non-team members to compete, namely at Varsity, our Club Competitions and friendly matches against other universities. </p>

        <p>Varsity is held in Spring term and is a 'friendly' competition against UWE. It is run in the same way as a BUCS competition, but both BUCS and non-BUCS teams are entered, which gives everyone a chance to have a go!</p>

        <p>After the success of past Club Competitions, we aim to run two competitions for riders of all levels to come and have a go in dressage and showjumping competitions. Come along and win your first rosette!</p>
