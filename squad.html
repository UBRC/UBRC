        <p>The University of Bristol Riding Club have a history of success in BUCS competitions, regularly qualifying for regional finals as well as reaching the National Championships.</p>

        <p>BUCS competitions consist of 3 rounds: 4 mini-leagues over the winter term, regionals in spring term for the winner and then nationals for the regional champions. Each event consists of a dressage test followed by a jumping round on a horse that the competitor has not ridden before. Before each section, you are given time to work-in - 7 minutes before dressage and 5 minutes before jumping. Each round is based on the skill of the rider rather than the ability of the horse. The competitions are run at riding schools, so there is no need to have your own horse.</p>

        <p>Team trials are held a couple of weeks into the Autumn Term and sign up sheets will be available at the Fresher's Fair and posted on our Facebook page.</p>

        <p>Previously, members of the Club have trained on Monday evenings with Australian Eventing Team member and Badminton Horse Trials winner Paul Tapner at his yard.</p>
