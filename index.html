            <h2>Welcome to the University of Bristol Riding Club! </h2>
            <p>Whether you are a complete beginner or have ridden all of your life, the Riding Club has something to offer you. When you sign up for lessons, you will be placed into a group with others of a similar ability to yourself and will head off to one of the local riding schools for lessons. Each group will have a driver, who takes the group to the stables as well as joining in with the lesson. We will do our best to place you into a group who want to ride on the same day as you, as frequently as you and who want to achieve the same out of their lessons as you do.</p>
